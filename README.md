# INCS 870 Project I 
## Overview
This is the project for course INCS 870 and we are team6. Our topic focuses on Twitter Bot Detection. The goal of this project is to identify and classify bot accounts on Twitter using various machine-learning techniques and data analysis methods. Through this project, we aim to contribute to improving the detection of automated or malicious behavior on social media platforms.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for analysis, including handling missing values and data normalization.
- **Feature Engineering:** Extracts key features according to the correlation
- **Model Training:** Utilizes machine learning models to classify accounts.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:**
- Pandas Numpy pickle
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
 
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## Installation
Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.
### Steps
